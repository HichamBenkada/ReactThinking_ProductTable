# Introduction:

This project is demonstrate my ability to think in React and use the five-step process provided by the React team to build a React application from scratch.

# Objectives:

The goal of this project is to demonstrated my ability to:
- Build a React application
- Create dynamically rendered components
- Handling arguiments with props
- Implements state to render content from arrays of data
- Apply software engineering best practices to successfully complete and deliver all the project requirements

# Implementation:

### Part 1: Creating the React Environment
For this project I have used vite@latest to create react project environement, then use npm (Node package manager) to install all dependencies needed for the project requirements.

### Part 2: Creating the React web application layout

- the _App_ is the main component contain the imported array of "leaners" data objects, that is used to initialize state of learners object as the key. This main component render <Learner> component that render each learner of the Learners object

- The _Learner_ component expected to desplay the name, the Boi and render the <Scores> component for each learner of the learners objects in an organized manner

- The _Scores_ component expected to display the date and the score for each score of each learner object

# Completion:
The layout and styling and the functionality of the web application are successfully implemented and the project is pushed to Github and deployed on Github pages
